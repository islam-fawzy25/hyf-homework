    <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication
        and commerce led by web development include e-com-
        merce.Online auction sites such as eBay have changed
        the way consumers find and purchase goods an servic-
        es.Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com
        (among many others) have transformed the shopping 
        and baragain-hunting experience for many consumers. </p>

    <h1 class="practical">practical web development</h1>
    <p>Since the commercialization of thhe web, web development has been a growing
         industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use 
their website to sell products and services to customers.[1] </p>

<p>There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
LAMAP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stck and Perl/Plack.This has kept the cost of
learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the
growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-develop-
ment software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual
Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and
implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials,
or face-to-face training. </p>

<p>An ever growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers bulid more
dynamic and interactive websites. Futuer, web developers now help to deliver
    applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applica-
 tions on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to de-
 centralize information and media distibution.Examples can be seen with the rise
 of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These
 web services allow users to interact with applications from many location,
 instead of being tied to a specific workstation for thier application enviroment.</p>
